### FAQ

#### Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so
detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project.
However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.

#### Why fluffy? Why is it pink and why are there so much emojis in the source code?
The most opensource messengers, like Conversations (XMPP) or Riot (Matrix) are great but have a very technical design. They are not much more complicated then messengers like Telegram or Whatsapp but I think they *feel* complicated, because of the user interface.
FluffyChat should look like a messenger, which targets also children. Because then, it will *feel* like "easy as a snap".
You don't like the colors? In the next versions, you will be able to change the colors and themes in the settings, so don't worry. ;-)

#### I do not receive push notifications :-(
 * Have you tried to logout and login?
 * Do you have an Ubuntu One account in the system settings?
 * When you go into fluffychat -> Settings -> Notifications -> Targets: Is there a device "UbuntuPhone"?
 * Do you have the latest version of fluffychat installed from the OpenStore?
 * Have you tried to turn airplaine mode on and off again? Sometimes notifications are sent with a delay from the UBports push service (will be fixed soon)
 If you still have the problem, then please contact me at the room: #fluffychat:matrix.org

#### How are push notifications working?
The notifications are sent from the matrix homeserver to the fluffychat push-gateway at: https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat-push-gateway
This gateway just beams the push to https://push.ubports.com/notify via https. The push-gateway is currently on my own server! I am NOT saving any data! It is just forwarding! However you can just host your own gateway if you want. There is currently no end-to-end encryption in fluffychat so you should not send any message-content from your homeserver, if you don't trust fluffychat or ubports!

#### I can not connect to my homeserver with port 8448
Sorry! ðŸ˜• On port 8448 the most homeservers use a different ssl certificate, which causes an error. Currently the xmlhttprequest in QML
does not allow those certificates.

#### I can not connect to my homeserver (self signed certificate)
The same problem ... I recommend you to use a letsencrypt certificate.
