# FAQ

#### I do not receive push notifications :-(
 * Have you tried to logout and login?
 * Do you have an Ubuntu One account in the system settings?
 * When you go into fluffychat -> Settings -> Notifications -> Targets: Is there a device "UbuntuPhone"?
 * Do you have the latest version of fluffychat installed from the OpenStore?
 * Have you tried to turn airplaine mode on and off again? Sometimes notifications are sent with a delay from the UBports push service (will be fixed soon)
 If you still have the problem, then please contact me at the room: #fluffychat:matrix.org

#### I can not connect to my homeserver with port 8448
Sorry! ðŸ˜• On port 8448 the most homeservers use a different ssl certificate, which causes an error. Currently the xmlhttprequest in QML
does not allow those certificates.

#### Which /commands are available?
* /me (Will send msgtype: m.emote)
Displays an action.

* /whisper (Will send msgtype: m.fluffychat.whisper)
The message text will be very small

* /roar (Will send msgtype: m.fluffychat.roar)
The message text will be very large, bold and in capital letters

* /shrug
Puts Â¯&#92;_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ at the start of the message

#### Which uri will open fluffychat?
* fluffychat://@user:server.abc will launch the user profile

* fluffychat://#room:server.abc will join the room with the given alias

* fluffychat://!chatid:server.abc will open the room with the given ID

#### I can not connect to my homeserver (self signed certificate)
The same problem ... I recommend you to use a letsencrypt certificate.
